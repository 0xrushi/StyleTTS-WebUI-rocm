# StyleTTS WebUI
An all-in-one inferencing and training WebUI for StyleTTS.  The intended compatbility is meant for Windows, but should still work with a little bit of modification for WSL or Linux.
> StyleTTS actually trains nicer in WSL than windows, so I might add compatibiltiy here sometime in the future
